# Chaos Subject Generator
The Chaos Subject Generator is a light weight random subject generator for artists, writers, or anyone who needs chaotic inspiration. The internal generator uses multiple subject generation patterns to make one-of-a-kind subjects, and is wrapped up in a nice, clean, and simple user interface.

Other features include a programmable timer, editable word lists, support for random seeds, and an always on top option.

The Chaos Subject Generator is still in alpha, meaning some features are incomplete or entirely missing, but you can still download and try the application today!
